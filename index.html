      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently enrolled in a 12-month Full-Stack Software Development bootcamp, where I'm learning to build modern web applications from scratch. I love solving problems, learning new technologies, and bringing ideas to life through code.

      <h2>Yoga & Mindfulness</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          I've been practicing yoga for over 8 years. In November 2024, I completed my yoga teacher training in Bali â€“ an experience that deepened not only my physical practice but also my understanding of mindfulness, breathwork, and holistic well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yoga helps me stay grounded, focused, and balanced â€“ both on and off the mat. It has taught me patience, presence, and the value of consistent inner work. I love exploring how these qualities can enrich my approach to programming and creative problem-solving.

        <p>
          I love to travel and explore different cultures. Southeast Asia holds a special place in my heart â€“ the people, food, and landscapes continue to inspire me. That said, I'm always open to discovering the beauty of other parts of the world as well!
